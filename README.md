# Ghosting Time ðŸ‘»

A _Flappy Bird_ alternative clone for macOS, developed in **Unity** and **C#**.

## Game Mechanics & Gameplay

Ghosting Time is an arcade-style casual game in which the player controls Gary the little ghost on a side-scroller space.

The player will allow the ghost to go through pairs of Hell-fire-topped columns (one on top, one on the bottom) spawning at random heights and with the same distance. 
The ghost will automatically go down and it will go higher when the player taps on the **space bar** only. 

Each pair of obstacles avoided will increase the score of 1 point. 
If the ghost collides with an obstacle, the game will be over!
